== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is reason of dropdown menu? =

Dropdown menu can provide aditional information about guest. For instance you can imagine that your friend has new girlfriend you have never seen hence you do not know her name.
And you want to invite her but sign "Bill's new chick" is not the right thing to put into attendance. So you allow Bill to add "+0" or "+1" so you will know, if his new girl comes with him.
